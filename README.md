# Alex's notebook

Based on the Zettelkasten method by Luhmann inspired by [How to take smart notes](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav). Plain-text format inspired by The Pragmatic Programmer.

## File system

There are top-level directories which present are _categories_. They're coded by a simple numeric ID (`1-cooking/`).

Files under that directory use their filenames as a reference system (`1a-five-flavours.md`). The `1` represents the category and the `a` shows that it's a related or sub-topic.

We simply nest files this way using an alphabetic system (`1aa-salt.md`, `1ab-bitter.md` and so on).
