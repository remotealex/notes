# Create more

I like _create more_ as a motto. Stop consuming, create more!

I don't need to learn more, I need to play more, practice more.

More yoga.

More journaling.

More guitar.

More poetry.

More article writing.

More re-reading my own notes.

More cooking.

More walking.

More meditation,

More talking with mates.

More planning.

More reflection.
