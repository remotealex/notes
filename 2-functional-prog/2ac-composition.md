# Composition

Composition is like a simple chain, you squash some functions together in a row and the output of the first function is passed straight to the second function, and so on.

In functional programming it's useful to write simple functions which can be chained (_composed_) together in different ways.

Not only are small functions easier to debug and reason, they're often reuseable and easy to refactor as they only handle one area of logic (if written correctly!).
