# First-class functions

A programming language has support for _first-class functions_ if it allows functions to be passed and returned as variables to and from other functions.

The `map` function is an example of a function which uses first-class functions. It takes a function and a _list_ as arguments, and applies the function to each element in the list. This would not be possible without first-class functions.
